# what is memory consumption

Unless specified otherwise, the following observations were made by running the `bsq` from [here](https://github.com/MrRobb/42_piscine/) against a 100 wide x 1000 tall board.

## Terms
|abbreviation|full name| what is that |
|-|-|-|
| `VIRT`| virtual memory | the maximum amount of memory the program could access
| `RES` |resident size | how much physical memory a process is consuming
| `S/SHR`| shared memory | amount of VIRT that is shareable w/ other processes (e.g. shared libraries)
[source: Lily Feng's blog](https://lilyfeng.wordpress.com/2013/07/17/the-difference-among-virt-res-and-shr-in-top-output/), more details [in this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20120520221529/http://emilics.com/blog/article/mconsumption.html)

## Tools
- `top`, `htop` (`man ...`)
- `heap`, `leaks` (...)

OK... `htop` shows a resident size of 980KiB.

what are those units?? --> [KiB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte) (1024-byte units)

and `leaks` says that 136KB have been malloc'd.

These tools must be measuring different things.
Here's a third tool, `heap`.  It shows the size of the malloced nodes.  Cool.

```

Hmm. The number of nodes is roughly proportional to the number of rows.  What if I change the height to 10,000 and drop the width to 10?

```
Process 71398: 10159 nodes malloced for 355 KB
```
Does this implementation malloc a string for every row? 

OK, but what about `RES`, the resident memory consumption?

# HMM...

still not clear on why the output from `leaks`/`heap` differ from `top`/`htop` by almost 10x.  That's ok.  We can move forward, comparing the RES memory footprint of processes.


#### Profiling Tools

## llvm-profdata
http://cmdlinelinux.blogspot.com/2018/04/profiling-c-code-with-clang-using.html | 

`xcrun llvm-profdata`


xcode-select: error: tool 'iprofiler' requires Xcode, but active developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance

`instruments` may be opened via xcode


Using clang, you may instrument a program to produce profiling output:
```
clang -fprofile-instr-generate -fcoverage-mapping *.c
./a.out
xcrun llvm-profdata show -all-functions -counts -ic-targets default.profraw
```

it looks like this:
```
  ft_atoi:
    Hash: 0x06219ff5750f6b2b
    Counters: 13

    Indirect Call Site Count: 0
    Block counts: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

# We can malloc absurd amounts of data, but it only shows up in `top/htop` when it is used.
e.g.
```

#include <stdlib.h>

#define ONE_THOUSAND 1000
#define TEN_M (10 * ONE_THOUSAND * ONE_THOUSAND)

int main()
{
    char *stuff;

    stuff = malloc(TEN_M);
    while (1)
    {
        ;
    }
}
```
has a RSS < 1 MiB (800 KiB reported by `htop`, 304 K reported by `top`)


but this uses the full 10M:
```
int main()
{
    char *stuff;

    stuff = malloc(TEN_M);
    for (int i = 0; i < TEN_M; i++)
    {
        stuff[i] = 0;
    }
    while (1)
    {
        ;
    }
}
```

and this uses only 5M!

```
int main()
{
    char *stuff;

    stuff = malloc(TEN_M);
    for (int i = 0; i < TEN_M / 2; i++)
    {
        stuff[i] = 0;
    }
    while (1)
    {
        ;
    }
}
```
