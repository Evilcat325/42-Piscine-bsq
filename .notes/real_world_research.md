There are papers about algorithims for finding Maximal Empty Rectangles (MERs)

- for finding free blocks on FPGAs, uses assumption about clustering of existing occupied rectangles
- their array consists of weighted cells.  The magnitude of positive weight indicates the amount of free space around a cell.  Conversely, negative weight indicates the amount of occupied space around the cell.

```
 Specifically,
we discover the set of all maximal empty rectangles. In Section 2, we formally
introduce this problem and place our work in the context of related work from the computational
geometry and arti3cial intelligence communities.
```
- introduces notion of staircases
